Magnetic Cave
=============

Project developed for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. (Concordia University, Fall 2012)

Magnetic Cave is a 2-player adversary board game where each player tries to build a bridge of 5 magnetic bricks within a cave whose left and right walls are magnetic. In order to place a brick in the board, the brick must be stacked on the wall or stacked to another brick that is stacked directly to the magnetic wall. <br>

The AI that plays the game was implemented using the minimax algorithm.<br>
